Soccer League Builder
This program takes a CSV file containing soccer league player information 
and separates the players into three teams that contain equal numbers of 
experienced and inexperienced players.

The team information is then written to a text file called teams.txt

Finally, personalized welcome letters addressed to the player's guardians
are then generated and written to their own text files. These letters
contain the team name the player has been assigned to and the date and time
of the first practice.
